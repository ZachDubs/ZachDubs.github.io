                <h4 class="summary">The oceanic whitetip shark is an open ocean shark. This shark is slow moving but very opportunistic and has a mean reputation. This shark has been famous for following ships out at sea looking for scraps thrown overboard. They also find and eat the remnants of whales that have died and started floating towards the surface. These sharks, with their large pectoral fins are commonly targeted for meals such as shark fin soup.</h4>

                <h4>The whale shark is the largest fish in the sea. It can grow to be larger than a school bus! The whale shark may be large, but it is no threat to humans. It is a filter feeder! This means that they eat tiny animals such as krill and small fish. These giant fish open their mouths and just swim around through schools of fish and krill. These sharks are very friendly and swimmers often ride on and swim with these magnificent creatures.</h4>

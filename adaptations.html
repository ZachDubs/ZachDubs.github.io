            <h4 class="summary">The hammerhead shark has a very oddly shaped head. This funny shape serves a purpose though. It allows the shark to locate prey that are hiding under the sand and rocks better. The tiger shark has specially designed teeth that allow them to eat sea turtles by being able to saw through their shells. The great white shark has developed a very athletic frame and distinct colors that act as camouflage hiding itself from its prey while being beneath it.<h4>

            <h4>All sharks share certain adaptations such as the ampullae of Lorenzini, the lateral line, and infinitely replenishing teeth.The ampullae of Lorenzini are electro-receptors that can sense different electric pulses in the water. The lateral line does something similar, it can sense movements in the water near the shark making it easier to locate prey that are close to the shark. Along with these incredible adaptations, sharks also have teeth that get broken and replaced non-stop. There are many rows of teeth visible in a shark's jaw at any given point in their life and more are developed within the gums.</h4>

            <h4>Sharks play a very important part in the oceanic food chain. If sharks continue to be over-fished, they may become extinct and that would eventually cause a great dying. Much of the ocean life would die off and we would run out of food.
